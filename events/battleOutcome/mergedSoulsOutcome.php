               Now, Old Havenwood stands as a haunting reminder of its former glory, its once bustling streets now overgrown with tangled vines and creeping ivy. The echoes of laughter and song have long since faded, replaced by an eerie silence broken only by the whispering winds and the occasional murmuring of the undead."

                As you were ruminating on your thoughts after the specters, Pog's voice cuts through the eerie silence, his words tinged with apprehension. "Oi, mate, looks like we've got ourselves a bit of a situation," he says, gesturing towards the swirling mass of souls that looms before you.
                You follow Pog's gaze and feel a chill run down your spine as you behold the grotesque spectacle before you. The mass of writhing specters coalesce into a towering monstrosity, its form shifting and contorting with each passing moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This ain't lookin' too good, mate," Pog mutters, his eyes fixed on the swirling mass of souls before you. "That there's the Merged Hellâ€”a foul creature born from the misery and despair of lost souls. Looks like these specters done merged together to form one big, angry spirit."
            </p>
            <p>
                Before you can react, the amorphous mass of souls coalesces into a towering monstrosity, its form twisted and contorted by the agony of countless tormented spirits. With a deafening roar, the Merged Hell looms over you and Pog, its spectral tendrils writhing hungrily as it prepares to unleash its wrath upon you.
